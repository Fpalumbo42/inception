This project is part of the curriculum at 42 and focuses on learning and implementing containerization using Docker. The goal is to set up a system with multiple services running in isolated containers using Docker Compose. You will need to create and configure a Nginx web server, a WordPress site, and a MariaDB database, ensuring that all components interact correctly within the containerized environment.
